# Project Repository

This repository will contain **ALL** the code, analysis, document and presentation for your group project.
 
There are four folders in the repository.

- **01 Data Scrapping**  
  In this folder we have four files. **Two .R** files and **two .Rdata** file.  
  **'01 Data Scrapping.R'** file contains the main code to scrape our data.  
  This R file ends up creating a **'data.Rdata'** file.  
  Then we did some work using **'data.Rdata'** in **'02 Creating new columns.R'** file and this creates the **finaldata.Rdata** file.  
  This **finaldata.Rdata** contains final data frame requied for our project.

- **02 Shiny App**  
  This flder contains only two files-  
  **Project_app.R** is our shiny app and **finaldata.Rdata** is the Rdata file containg the data frame. This Rdata file is needed to be in the working directory.
  
- **03 Presentation**  
  This folder contains only the ppt file **Presentation_Group_7.pptx** for the presentation.
  
- **04 Project Report**  
  This folder contains five files.
  - The final project report, **Project_Report.pdf**
  - The R Markdown file of the report, **Project_Report.Rmd**
  - The **finaldata.Rdata** file that again needs to be in the working directory while running the Project_Report.Rmd file.
  - Two pictures that we inserted in the project report. These also need to be in the working diretory.
